```

All commands are available via the `capfence` entry point.

## `capfence check`

Statically scan a Python codebase for ungated AI agent tools.

### Synopsis

```
capfence check [OPTIONS] [PATH]
```

### Description

Parses Python files with the AST module, identifies tool classes and functions (LangChain `BaseTool`, CrewAI `BaseTool`, or function-based tools), and flags any that are **not** wrapped with a CapFence adapter. Supports cross-file wrapper detection — a tool defined in `tools.py` and wrapped in `agent.py` is correctly detected as gated.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `PATH` | Directory or file to scan. Defaults to current directory `.` |
| `-o, --output PATH` | Write HTML report to file |
| `--framework TEXT` | Filter findings by framework (`langchain`, `crewai`, `openai_agents`, `mcp`) |
| `--exclude-dir TEXT` | Exclude directories (default: `venv`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `.git`) |
| `--fail-on-ungated` | Exit with non-zero code if high-risk ungated tools are found |

### Examples

```bash
# Scan current directory
capfence check

# Scan specific path with HTML report
capfence check ./src -o report.html

# CI/CD — block deploy if ungated tools exist
capfence check ./src --fail-on-ungated

# Filter to LangChain tools only
capfence check ./src --framework langchain
```

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Scan completed, no ungated high-risk tools (or `--fail-on-ungated` not set) |
| 1 | `--fail-on-ungated` set and ungated high-risk tools found |
| 2 | Invalid arguments or path not found |

## `capfence assess`

Full risk assessment with taxonomy enrichment and compliance mapping.

### Synopsis

```
capfence assess [OPTIONS] PATH
```

### Description

Runs the static scanner, enriches findings with taxonomy data (risk keywords, thresholds, compliance frameworks), and generates a professional HTML report with executive summary, risk breakdown, and remediation plan.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `PATH` | Directory to assess |
| `-o, --output PATH` | Output HTML report path |
| `-t, --taxonomy TEXT` | Taxonomy to use (`general`, `financial`, `legal`, `financial_plaid`) |
| `--compliance` | Include SOX/PCI-DSS/GDPR compliance mappings |

### Examples

```bash
# Basic assessment
capfence assess ./src

# Financial taxonomy with compliance mappings
capfence assess ./src --taxonomy financial --compliance -o assessment.html

# Plaid-specific fintech assessment
capfence assess ./src --taxonomy financial_plaid
```

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Assessment completed successfully |
| 1 | Assessment failed (invalid path, parse errors, or internal error) |

## `capfence simulate`

Replay agent execution traces through the CapFence gate.

### Synopsis

```
capfence simulate [OPTIONS]
```

### Description

Reads a JSONL trace file (one JSON object per line, each representing a tool call) and replays each call through the gate. Compares static vs. adaptive scoring side-by-side. Useful for regression testing and detecting behavioral drift.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--trace-file PATH` | JSONL trace file to replay (required) |
| `-t, --taxonomy TEXT` | Taxonomy to use |
| `--compare` | Compare static vs. adaptive scoring results |
| `-o, --output PATH` | Write comparison report to file |

### Examples

```bash
# Replay traces with static scoring
capfence simulate --trace-file traces.jsonl --taxonomy general

# Compare static vs. adaptive
capfence simulate --trace-file traces.jsonl --taxonomy general --compare

# Save comparison report
capfence simulate --trace-file traces.jsonl --compare -o comparison.html
```

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Simulation completed |
| 1 | Invalid trace file or internal error |

---

## `capfence build-taxonomy`

Interactively build a custom risk taxonomy.

### Synopsis

```
capfence build-taxonomy [OPTIONS]
```

### Description

Prompts for industry, payment methods, and compliance frameworks, then generates a tailored JSON taxonomy file. The generated taxonomy can be loaded via `--taxonomy` in other commands.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-o, --output PATH` | Output JSON file path (default: `custom-taxonomy.json`) |

### Examples

```bash
# Interactive build
capfence build-taxonomy

# Save to specific file
capfence build-taxonomy -o my-taxonomy.json
```

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Taxonomy built successfully |
| 1 | Build cancelled or error |

---

## `capfence verify`

Verify the integrity of a hash-chained audit log.

### Synopsis

```
capfence verify [OPTIONS] AUDIT_LOG
```

### Description

Reads an SQLite audit log database and verifies the SHA-256 hash chain linking all entries. If Ed25519 signing is enabled, also verifies signatures. Reports any tampered, missing, or out-of-order entries.

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `AUDIT_LOG` | Path to SQLite audit database (default: `audit.db`) |

### Examples

```bash
# Verify default audit.db
capfence verify

# Verify specific database
capfence verify /var/log/capfence.db
```

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Chain valid, no tampering detected |
| 1 | Chain invalid — tampering or corruption detected |
| 2 | Database not found or unreadable |
